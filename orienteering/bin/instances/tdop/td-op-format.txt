The TD-OP requires 3 types of input files: 
- the speed matrix
- the adapted TOP instances of Chao
- the arc category matrix

*****************************
* The speed matrix *
*****************************

This matrix (speedmatrix.txt) (size k*c) contains a speed level for every time period (k) and arc category type (c).
For all our instances k is set to 4 and c to 5.
time period 0 7am-9am
time period 1 9am-5pm
time period 2 5pm-7pm
time period 3 7pm-12pm

arc category 0: Always busy
arc category 1: Morning peak
arc category 2: Two peak
arc category 3: Evening peak
arc category 4: Seldom traveled

The same speed matrix is used for all instances.

*****************************
* Adapted TOP instances *
*****************************

These instances were developed by Chao et al 1994 (The team orienteering problem, European Journal of Operations Research 88, 464-474)
The original instances, divided into 7 dataset based on the underlying graphs, are developed by altering the number of paths and Tmax.

We fixed the number of paths, P, to 1 and rescaled the coordinates to allow more feasibles routes per day. The coordinates in the original datasets were divided by a specific factor per dataset in order to obtain the datasets in the attached files.
Since we assumed that trips start at the start depot at 7 am and end at the end depot before 9 pm, varying the avalaible travel time (Tmax) within this range allows to create multiple instances based on the same graph information.

The first three lines of the instance txt-file contains the following data: 
n N 
m P
tmax Tmax

Where
N = number of vertices
P = number of paths (in these instances always 1)
Tmax = available time budget per path



The remaining lines contain the data of each vertex. 
For each vertex, the line contains the following data:

x y S

Where
x = x coordinate 
y = y coordinate
S = score

* REMARKS *
- The first vertex is the start vertex.
- The last vertex is the end vertex.
- The Euclidian distance is used. The result is divided by 5 for each instance to allow more feasibles routes per day. (This is a generic rescaling for all datasets, different from the one mentioned above.) 

*****************************
* Arc category matrix *
*****************************

This matrix (arc_cat_x.txt) of size NÂ² defines the arc category of every arc between two vertices.
Since all test instances belonging to the same dataset are based on the same graph, the same arc category matrix can be used for every instance belonging to that dataset.

arc category 0: Always busy
arc category 1: Morning peak
arc category 2: Two peak
arc category 3: Evening peak
arc category 4: Seldom traveled
